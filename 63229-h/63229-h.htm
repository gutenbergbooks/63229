<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span> STRENUOUS STRUGGLE, a vigorous campaign, is
before any housewife who is called upon to dispute
the occupancy of her home with that persistent
pest unfavorably known as the bedbug, who, gorged
with the blood of his victim, lieth up in his lair from
daylight to candlelight, only to swoop down upon his
helpless sleeping prey during the midnight watches.</p>

<p>Even a flood of gas or electric light will not protect the
human host, for the stress of hunger will cause the bedbug
to emerge from its place of concealment in a well-lighted
room at night, and even attack, voraciously, in
broad daylight, if long without food.</p>

<p>Certain natural enemies of this pest are to be found
in our homes, but they are almost as unwelcome to the
housewife as the bedbug itself, and, besides, furnish
little, if any, effective control.</p>

<p>There are remedies&mdash;many of the most effective of
which are the old-fashioned household remedies, some
are preparations recently put on the market by their
manufacturers, while others are fumigants, requiring
more than common care and more than ordinary intelligence
in their use, as the gases are deadly poisons.</p>

<p class="pmb2">This bulletin tells all about them&mdash;but the main factor
of success is eternal vigilance.</p>

<h2><a name="ITS_PRESENCE_EXPLAINED" id="ITS_PRESENCE_EXPLAINED">ITS PRESENCE EXPLAINED.</a></h2>

<div class="dropcap">T</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE presence of the bedbug (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) in a house is not necessarily
an indication of neglect or carelessness; for, little as the idea may
be relished, this insect may gain access in spite of the adoption of
all reasonable precautions. It is very apt to get into the trunks
and satchels of travelers, or into baskets of laundry, and may thus
be introduced into homes. Unfortunately, also, it is quite capable
of migrating from one house to another and will often continue to
come from an adjoining house, sometimes for a period of several
months, gaining entrance daily. Such migration is especially likely
to take place if the human inhabitants of an infested house leave
it. With the failure of their usual source of food, the migratory
instinct of the bedbugs is developed, and, escaping through windows,
they pass along walls, water pipes, or gutters, and thus gain
entrance into adjoining houses. In these or other ways anyone's
premises may be temporarily invaded.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the presence of the bedbug in houses, both from the
standpoint of personal comfort and the possible carriage of disease,
is not to be lightly considered, and the failure on the part of anyone
to institute immediate efforts of eradication will warrant the odium
which is properly attached to "buggy" premises. The most important
purpose of this bulletin is, in addition to giving a general
account of this house pest, to indicate effective means by which it
can be eradicated promptly.</p>

<h2><a name="ORIGIN_COMMON_NAMES_DISTRIBUTION" id="ORIGIN_COMMON_NAMES_DISTRIBUTION">ORIGIN; COMMON NAMES; DISTRIBUTION.</a></h2>


<p>As with nearly all the insects associated with man, the bedbug has
had the habits now characteristic of it as far back as the records run.
It was undoubtedly of common occurrence in the dwellings of the
ancient peoples of Asia. The Romans were well acquainted with it,
giving it the name Cimex. It was supposed by Pliny&mdash;and this
was doubtless the common belief among the Romans&mdash;to have
medicinal properties, and it was recommended, among other things,
as a specific for the bites of serpents. It is said to have been first
introduced into England in 1503, but the references to it are of such
a nature as to make it very probable that it had been there long
before. Two hundred and fifty years later it was reported to be
very abundant in the seaport towns, but was scarcely known inland.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 423px;"><a id="fig1"></a>

</div>

<p>One of the old English names was "wall-louse." It was afterward
very well known as the "chinch," which continued to be the
common appellation for it until within a century or two, and is still
used in parts of this country. The origin of the name "bedbug" is
not known, but it is such a descriptive one that it would seem to
have been very naturally suggested. Almost everywhere there are
local names for these parasites, as, for illustration, around Boston
they are called "chintzes" and "chinches," and from Baltimore
comes the name "mahogany flat," while in New York they are
styled "red coats," and in the west "crimson ramblers."</p>

<p>The bedbug has accompanied man wherever he has gone. Ships
are very apt to be infested with it and have been the chief means of
its wide distribution. It probably came to this country with the
earliest colonists; at least Kalm, writing in 1748-49, stated that it
was plentiful in the English colonies and in Canada, though unknown
among the Indians.</p>

<h2><a name="VARIETIES_AND_RELATED_INSECTS" id="VARIETIES_AND_RELATED_INSECTS">VARIETIES AND RELATED INSECTS.</a></h2>


<p>What may eventually prove to be mere variations of the ordinary
type of human bedbug have been described as distinct species in several
instances. For example, the common bedbug of southern Asia is
supposed to present some slight variations from the European type,
chiefly in being somewhat more elongate. These slightly diverging
forms of the bedbug in different parts of the world, which are not
known to have any special bird or animal host other than human
beings, may prove to be merely local races or varieties of the ordinary
bedbug.</p>

<p>Birds, bats, and poultry are attacked in various parts of the world
by a considerable number of parasitic bugs, closely related to the
bedbug, which live on their hosts and in nests and about roosting
places. One of these species, occurring abundantly in southwestern
United States and Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> probably originally a parasitic messmate
on birds and bats, has come to be an unmitigated poultry pest, and
from the close association in these regions between poultry and human
beings, is often a serious house pest&mdash;more so even than the true bedbug.
Others of the species infesting birds and bats may also on occasion
become house pests. For example, the nests of the common
barn or eaves swallow of this country often swarm with the barn-swallow
bug,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and from such nests under the eaves of dwelling
houses these bugs sometimes gain entrance to houses and beds and
are the cause of much annoyance. Similarly a species,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> normally a
parasite of birds and bats in the Old World, and also in Brazil and
the West Indies, not infrequently becomes a human parasite.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Bedbug: Adult before engorgement. Much enlarged.
(Author's illustration.)</div>
</div>

<p>The bedbug belongs to the order Hemiptera, which includes the
true bugs or piercing insects, characterized by possessing a piercing
and sucking beak. The bedbug is to man what the chinch bug is
to grains or the squash bug to cucurbs. Like nearly all the insects
parasitic on animals, however, it is degraded structurally, its parasitic
nature and the slight necessity for extensive locomotion having
resulted, after many ages doubtless, in the loss of wings and the
assumption of a comparatively simple structure. Before feeding, the
adult (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) is much flattened, oval, and in color is rust red, with
the abdomen more or less tinged with black. When engorged the
body becomes much bloated and elongated and brightly colored
from the ingested blood. The wings are represented by the merest
rudiments, barely recognizable pads, and the simple eyes or ocelli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
of most other true bugs are lacking. The absence of wings is a most
fortunate circumstance, since otherwise there would be no safety
from it even for the most careful of housekeepers. Some slight variation
in length of wing pads has been observed, but none with
wings showing any considerable development has ever been found.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THE_BUGGY_ODOR" id="THE_BUGGY_ODOR">THE "BUGGY" ODOR.</a></h2>


<p>The most characteristic feature of the bedbug is the very distinct
and disagreeable odor which it exhales, an odor well known to all
who have been familiar with it as the "buggy" odor. This odor is
by no means limited to the bedbug, but is characteristic of most
plant bugs also. The common chinch bug affecting small grains
and the squash bugs all possess this odor, and it is quite as pungent
with these plant-feeding forms as with the human parasite. The
possession of this odor, disagreeable as it is, is very fortunate after
all, as it is of considerable assistance in
detecting the presence of these vermin.
The odor comes from glands, situated
in various parts of the body, which secrete
a clear, oily, volatile liquid. With
the plant-feeding forms this odor is certainly
a means of protection against insectivorous birds, rendering these insects
obnoxious or distasteful to their
feathered enemies. With the bedbug,
on the other hand, it is probably an
illustration of a very common phenomenon among animals, i. e., the persistence
of a characteristic which is no
longer of any especial value to the possessor. The natural enemies
of true bugs, against which this odor serves as a means of protection,
in the conditions under which the bedbug lives, are kept
away from it; and the roach, which sometimes feeds on bedbugs, is
evidently not deterred by the odor, while the common house ant
and the house centipede, which may also attack the bedbug, seem
not to find this odor disagreeable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HABITS_AND_LIFE_HISTORY" id="HABITS_AND_LIFE_HISTORY">HABITS AND LIFE HISTORY.</a></h2>


<p>The bedbug is normally nocturnal in habits and displays a certain
degree of wariness, caution, and intelligence in its efforts at concealment
during the day. Under the stress of hunger, however, it will
emerge from its place of concealment in a well-lighted room at night,
so that under such circumstances keeping the gas or electric light
burning is not a complete protection. It has been known under
similar conditions to attack human beings voraciously in broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7 ]</a></span>
daylight. It usually leaves its victim as soon as it has become
engorged with blood and retires to its normal place of concealment,
either in cracks in the bedstead, especially if the latter be one of the
wooden variety, or behind wainscoting, or under loose wall paper,
and in these and similar places it manifests its gregarious habit by
collecting in masses. It thrives particularly in filthy apartments
and in old houses which are full of cracks and crevices, in which it
can conceal itself beyond easy reach. As just noted the old-fashioned,
heavy, wooden-slatted bedsteads afford especially favorable situations
for the concealment and multiplication of this insect, and the
general use in later years of iron and brass bedsteads has very greatly
facilitated its eradication. Such beds, however, do not insure safety,
as the insects are able to find places of concealment even about such
beds, or get to them readily from their other hiding places.</p>

<p>Extraordinary stories are current of the remarkable intelligence of
this insect in circumventing various efforts to prevent its gaining
access to beds. Most of these are undoubtedly exaggerations, but
the inherited experience of many centuries of companionship with
man, during which the bedbug has always found its host an active
enemy, has resulted in a knowledge of the habits of the human
animal and a facility of concealment, particularly as evidenced by
its abandoning beds and often going to distant quarters for protection
and hiding during daylight, which indicate considerable apparent
intelligence.</p>

<p>Like its allies, the bedbug undergoes what is known as an incomplete
metamorphosis. In other words, the insect from its larval to
its adult stage is active and similar in form, structure, and habit,
contrasting with flies and moths in their very diverse life stages of
larva, chrysalis, or pupa, and winged adult.</p>

<p>The eggs (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3, <i>d</i></a>) are white oval objects having a little projecting
rim around one edge and may be found in batches of from 6 to 50
in cracks and crevices where the parent bugs go for concealment.
In confinement eggs may be deposited almost daily over a period
of two months or more and commonly at the rate of from one to
five eggs per day, but sometimes much larger batches are laid. As
many as 190 eggs have been thus obtained from a single captured
female.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

the adult. <i>In</i> Jour. Econ. Biol., v. 9, no. 1, p. 25-45. 1914.</p></div>

<p>The eggs hatch in a week or 10 days in the hot weather of midsummer,
but cold may lengthen or even double this egg period or
check development altogether. The young escape by pushing up the
lid-like top with its projecting rim. When first emerged (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3, <i>a, b</i></a>)
they are yellowish white and nearly transparent, the brown color of
the more mature insect increasing with the later molts (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).</p>

</div>


<p>During the course of its development the bedbug molts or sheds
its skin normally five times, and with the last molt the minute wing
pads, characteristic of the adult insect, make their appearance. A
period of about 11 weeks was formerly supposed to be necessary for
the complete maturity of the insect, but breeding experiments with
this insect, conducted in this department in. 1896, indicated that
the life cycle is subject to great variation, being entirely dependent
on warmth and food supply. Under favorable conditions of temperature
and food it was found that there was an average period of about
eight days between moltings and between the laying of eggs and
their hatching, giving about seven weeks as the period under these
conditions from egg to adult insect. The molting periods are shorter
in the earlier stages and lengthen in the later stages. There are many
exceptions, however, and some individuals even under the same
conditions remain two or three weeks without molting. Under conditions
of famine, or without food, as already shown, the bedbug may
remain unchanged in any of the immature stages for an indefinite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9 ]</a></span>
time, and the checking of development by such starvation may result
in additional molting periods.</p>

<p>The breeding records referred to, and numerous confirmatory
experiments subsequently made by other investigators, indicate
that ordinarily but one meal is taken between molts, so that each
bedbug must puncture its host five times before becoming mature,
and at least once afterwards before it can develop eggs. Additional
meals between molts may be taken under favoring circumstances,
however, and particularly when the insect has been disturbed and
has not become fully engorged at its first meal after a molting or
other period. The bedbug takes from 5 to 10 minutes to become
bloated with blood, and then retires to its place of concealment for
6 to 10 days for the quiet digestion of its enormous meal, and for
subsequent molting, or reproduction if in the adult stage.</p>

<p>Such feeding and reproduction may, under favorable conditions of
temperature, continue throughout the year, and in one instance the
progeny of a captured female adult was carried through three continuous
generations.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

its different stages. <i>In</i> Jour. Econ. Biol., v. 7, no. 4, p. 163-188.
1912.</p></div>

<p>Unfavorable conditions of temperature and food will necessarily
result in great variation in the number of generations annually and
in the rate of multiplication, but allowing for reasonable checks on
development, there may be at least four successive broods in a year
in houses kept well heated in winter.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions the food of the common bedbug is
obtained from human beings only, and no other unforced feeding
habit has been reported. It is easily possible, however, to force the
bedbug to feed on mice, rats, birds, etc., and probably it may do so
occasionally in nature in the absence of its normal host. The
abundance of this insect in houses which have long been untenanted
may occasionally be accounted for by such other sources of food, but
probably normally such infestation can be explained by the natural
longevity of the insect and its ability to survive for practically a year,
and perhaps more, without food.</p>

<p>There are many records indicating the ability of the bedbug to
survive for long periods without food, and specimens have been kept
for a year in a sealed vial with absolutely no means of sustenance
whatever. In the course of the department's study of this insect in
1896, young bedbugs, obtained from eggs, were kept in small sealed
vials for several months, remaining active in spite of the fact that
they had never taken any nourishment whatever. A considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span>
series of experiments was later conducted by Girault<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> bearing on the
longevity of the insect under different conditions. A large number
of adults of both sexes were kept in confinement, but with normal
feeding and mating, and these survived for periods ranging from 54
to 316 days. Similarly, the life of 71 newly hatched larv&aelig;, without
food, ranged from 17 to 42 days, averaging about 28 days. Partly
grown captured insects lived without further feeding from 17 to 60
days. Longevity is naturally affected more or less by temperatures.
In other words, temperatures sufficient to check the activity of the
insect and produce hibernation or semihibernation are apt to increase
longevity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Loc. cit.</p></div>

<p>The fact that the bedbug is able to survive for such long periods
without human blood has led to the theory that it could subsist in
some fashion on the moisture from wood or from accumulations of
dust in crevices in flooring, etc. There seems to be no basis of
observed fact for this idea.</p>

<p>Another very prevalent belief among the old settlers in the West,
that this insect normally lives on dead or diseased cottonwood logs,
and is almost certain to abound in log houses of this wood, seems to
be equally devoid of basis. As illustrating this belief, the department
has on file a very definite report from an Army officer that the
bedbug often occurs in numbers under the bark of dead cottonwood
trees,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> especially along the Big Horn and Little Horn Rivers in
Montana. The basis of this report and the origin of this very general
misconception is probably, as pointed out by the late Prof. Riley,
due to a confusion of the bedbug with the immature stages of an
entirely distinct insect,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which somewhat resembles the bedbug and
often occurs under cottonwood bark.</p>

<h2><a name="INFLUENCE_OF_TEMPERATURE" id="INFLUENCE_OF_TEMPERATURE">INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE.</a></h2>


<p>As a messmate of human beings in dwelling houses, the bedbug is
normally protected from extreme cold, and is known to be an
abundant and serious pest far north. In fact, it is often more
troublesome in north temperate latitudes than farther south. This
may be accounted for partly by the fact that the bedbug is very
sensitive to high temperatures, and a temperature of 96&deg; to 100&deg; F.
or more, accompanied with a fairly high degree of humidity, results
in the death of large numbers of the bugs. The mature or partly
mature bedbugs can stand comparatively low temperatures, even
below freezing, for a considerable period. The eggs and newly
hatched larv&aelig;, however, succumb to a temperature below freezing,
if this condition is prolonged for from 15 days to a month. The
feeding and developing activity of the insect practically ceases at
60&deg; F., the insect remaining quiescent and in semihibernation at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span>
temperatures below this point. The most favorable temperatures
for activity are between 60&deg; and 98&deg; F.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The activity of the insect
is controlled entirely by temperature and food supply, and, therefore,
in heated houses the insect may remain active throughout the
winter. There is some protection in winter, therefore, in sleeping in
cold bedrooms.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BITE_OF_THE_BEDBUG" id="THE_BITE_OF_THE_BEDBUG">THE BITE OF THE BEDBUG.</a></h2>


<p>The bite of the bedbug is decidedly poisonous to some individuals,
resulting in a slight swelling and disagreeable inflammation. To such
persons the presence of bedbugs is sufficient to cause the greatest
uneasiness, if not to put sleep and rest entirely out of the question.
With others, however, who are less sensitive, the presence of the bugs
may not be recognized at all, and, except for the occasional staining
of the linen by a crushed individual, their presence might be entirely
overlooked. The inflammation experienced by sensitive persons
seems to result chiefly from the puncture of the skin by the sharp
piercing set&aelig; which constitute the puncturing element of the mouth
parts, as there seems to be no secretion of poison other than the
natural fluids of the mouth.</p>

<p>The biting organ of the bedbug is similar to that of other insects of
its order. It consists of a rather heavy, fleshy under lip (the only
part ordinarily seen in examining the insect), within which lie four
threadlike hard filaments or set&aelig; which glide over one another with
an alternating motion and pierce the flesh. The blood is drawn up
through the beak, which is closely applied to the point of puncture,
and the alternating motion of the set&aelig; in the flesh causes the blood
to flow more freely. The details of the structure of the beak are
shown in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> at <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>To allay the irritation set up by the bite of the bedbug, peroxide
of hydrogen, or dioxygen, may be used with good results.</p>

<p>Tincture of iodine either at ordinary or double strength is also a
good counter-irritant for use in cases of flea, mosquito, bedbug, and
other insect bites, but should be used with caution on the tender
skin of small children and on those who are affected with or disposed
to eczemic disorders.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BEDBUG_AND_HUMAN_DISEASES" id="THE_BEDBUG_AND_HUMAN_DISEASES">THE BEDBUG AND HUMAN DISEASES.</a></h2>


<p>In common with other insects which attack man and warm-blooded
animals, it is entirely possible for the bedbug and its close
allies to be transmitters of contagious human diseases, and already
these insects have been shown to be possible carriers or transmitters
of a considerable series of diseases, including infantile Kala-azar of
northern Africa and southern Europe, relapsing fever of Africa and
Europe, the Chagas fever of Brazil, tropical sore, plague, and possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span>
leprosy. In the case of these, and perhaps other diseases, the bedbug
shares the responsibility of transmitter with other biting insects,
such as body lice and fleas.</p>

<p>The particular role of the bedbug as a carrier of disease has not
been satisfactorily determined, nor has it been shown that the bedbug
is a necessary alternate host in any instance. In general, the
transmission of disease by this insect has apparently resulted from
the accidental carriage of the disease elements on the mouth parts,
as pointed out by Andr&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> after a careful study of the subject. As a
parasite of human beings in private dwelling houses, where it may
seldom change its host, the opportunity for the bedbug itself to
become infected with human diseases and again to transmit them
to the human subject is very remote. This condition, however, does
not apply to hotels or to passenger boats, where the human occupants
are constantly changing. Furthermore, the fact that the bedbug
attacks its host at comparatively long intervals of from a week
to several weeks or months acts as a bar to its transmission of certain
insect-borne diseases, the biology of which requires a definite and
comparatively short period of development in the alternate insect
host.</p>

<h2><a name="NATURAL_ENEMIES_OF_THE_BEDBUG" id="NATURAL_ENEMIES_OF_THE_BEDBUG">NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE BEDBUG.</a></h2>


<p>Living always in houses as it does and being well concealed, the
bedbug is not normally subject to much if any control by natural
enemies. Certain other household insects, however, do occasionally
prey upon the bedbug, as, for example, the house centipede<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the
common little red house ant.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Such enemies, however, are of very
small importance and yield little, if any, effective control except
under very exceptional circumstances. One such instance is reported
by the late Mr. Theodore Pergande, of this department, who states
that as a soldier in the Civil War he occupied at one time a barracks
at Meridian, Miss., which had been abandoned some time before.
The premises proved to be swarming with bedbugs; but very shortly
afterwards the little red house ant discovered the presence of the
bedbugs and came in enormous numbers, and Mr. Pergande witnessed
the very interesting and pleasing sight of the bedbugs being dismembered
and carried away bodily by these very minute ants, many
times smaller than the bugs which they were handling so successfully.
The result was that in a single day the bedbug nuisance was completely
abated. The liking of red ants for bedbugs is confirmed also by a
correspondent writing from Florida (F. C. M. Boggess), who goes so
far as heartily to recommend the artificial introduction of the ants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[ 13 ]</a></span>
to abate this bug nuisance.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Bedbugs and other household insects,
however, are not of the sort which it is convenient or profitable to
turn over to their natural enemies in the hope that eradication by
this means will follow, and the fact that they are preyed upon by
other insects furnishes no excuse to the housekeeper for not instituting
prompt remedial measures.</p>

<h2><a name="REMEDIES" id="REMEDIES">REMEDIES.</a></h2>


<p>Undoubtedly the most efficient remedy for the bedbug is to fumigate
the infested house or rooms with hydrocyanic-acid gas. This gas
will penetrate into every crevice in the house or room where the
bedbugs conceal themselves and has an immediate effectiveness
which gives it an important recommendation, especially when the
infestation is considerable or of long standing. This method of
fumigation should be intelligently employed, as the gas is deadly
poisonous. A bulletin giving directions for such fumigation has been
issued by the Department of Agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Howard, L. O., and Popenoe, C. H. Hydrocyanic-acid gas against
household insects. U. S. Dept. Agr. Farmers' Bul. 699. 8 p. 1916.</p></div>

<p>The fumes of burning sulphur are also a very efficient means of
control where the conditions are such that this method can be used,
readily destroying the insect in all stages, including the egg. The
treatment is inexpensive compared with the use of hydrocyanic-acid
gas and offers much less risk of danger to human beings. There
is, however, a considerable risk of injury to household fabrics, furnishings,
and wall papers from the strong bleaching quality of sulphur
fumes. This danger will be somewhat diminished if the fumigation
can be done at a time when the room or house is thoroughly dried out,
as in winter by a furnace or other heating system. Further precautions
should be taken by removing all metallic surfaces from the
room or building, or by protecting them with a coating of vaseline.
Two pounds of sulphur are recommended for each 2,000 cubic feet of
space, and the building should be closed for the treatment for at least
5 or 6 hours, or preferably for 24 hours. Sulphur candles may be
used where available, or the sulphurous gas or fumes can be generated
by burning the sulphur in a dish placed in the center of the room, and
for protection set within a larger vessel. Thorough-going precautions
must be taken to prevent accidental overflowing or the starting of a
fire, and after the fumigation the house should be given a thorough
airing.</p>

<p>Other gases have been experimented with, such as formalin and
the vapors of benzine, naphthaline, and camphor, but these gases are
of little value. Similarly, insect powders are of little value, largely
from the difficulty of getting them into the crevices and other places
of concealment of the insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the use of poisonous gas is difficult or objectionable, especially
if only one room is infested, the pests may be eliminated by
the application of kerosene, benzene, or any of the lighter petroleum
oils, by means of a small hand sprayer. The liquid should be directed
at close range into all cracks and crevices in the walls and
behind loose wall paper. Open spaces back of baseboards and picture
moldings should be liberally treated. The bedstead and springs
should receive the same attention, care being taken to spray the
liquid into all crevices. The mattress should likewise be carefully
gone over. All seams and spaces beneath tuftings should be thoroughly
dosed. At the expiration of 10 days the entire treatment
should be repeated with the same care, regardless of whether any
bugs are seen or not. If the two applications are made with painstaking
care this should be sufficient for complete eradication.</p>

<p><i>Temperature control.</i>&mdash;The possibility of temperature control is
indicated in the discussion elsewhere of the effect of temperature
on this insect. A temperature maintained below freezing for 10 or
15 days destroys the eggs, and this temperature continued for
15 days to a month will destroy the newly hatched young. It
may be, therefore, that if infested houses in cold climates should be
opened up and allowed to remain at a temperature well below freezing
for a considerable period, all eggs and the young, and possibly
most if not all of the adults, would be exterminated. This method of
control might perhaps be practicable at least in the case of summer
houses in the north which are left untenanted in the winter.</p>

<p>The maintaining of high temperatures may be an even more efficient
method of control. The activity of the bedbug is at its greatest
between 60&deg; and 70&deg; to 75&deg;. As indicated elsewhere, in a temperature
of 96&deg; to 100&deg; F., accompanied with a high degree of humidity,
newly hatched bedbugs perish within a few days, and, if this temperature
is raised to 113&deg; F., in a few minutes. A temperature of
113&deg; will also destroy the eggs, and with these higher temperatures
the item of humidity is not apparently important.</p>

<p>A very practical test of this method of control was made in
Ontario, Canada, by the Dominion Entomological Department,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
adapting the method of control of insects infesting granaries and
flour mills by superheating. In this instance an eight-room, two-story
frame house, badly infested with bedbugs, was during the
month of July brought to a very high degree of heat by making
up good fires in the heating furnace and other stoves in the house
and closing up the house to retain the heat. Recording thermometers
placed in different rooms indicated a gradual rise of temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
from 77&deg; to 160&deg; during the period from 9.30 in the morning
to 7.30 in the evening, the outside temperatures during the
same period ranging from 64&deg; to 73&deg; F. At 1.30, when the temperature
in the different rooms ranged from 109&deg; to 130&deg;, many
adults and immature forms had already succumbed. By 4.30 the
temperature was ranging from 127&deg; to 148&deg; in different rooms,
and all the insects were dead. The continuation of the experiment
was on the supposition that it would probably require a higher
degree of temperature to destroy the eggs. The eradication of
the bedbug from this house was complete, and no damage was done
to the house or its contents. That the temperatures ranged much
higher than was necessary is indicated by the temperature experiments
referred to elsewhere, which indicated that the eggs as well
as larv&aelig; are destroyed within a few minutes at a temperature of
113&deg; F. The latter temperature was also sufficient to destroy quickly
the adults of fleas, cockroaches, and other insects. It would seem,
therefore, that superheating of houses in midsummer to a temperature
of 120&deg; to 130&deg; F. may prove to be one of the simplest and
most effective means of eradication of this and perhaps other household
pests.</p>
